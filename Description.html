                        Nowadays, targeted and immune-based therapies have already transformed the standard-of‑care for
                        several malignancies. Oncolytic virus, as an attractive therapeutic combination of the advantage
                        of
                        tumor-specific cell lysis together with immune stimulation, are emerging as important agents in
                        cancer treatment.</p>
                    <p>Oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach to cancer treatment that utilizes
                        native or genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate within tumor cells. OVs
                        mediate
                        antitumor activity through two distinct mechanisms of action: selective replication within
                        neoplastic cells, resulting in a direct lytic effect on tumor cells and induction of systemic
                        antitumor immunity [1].

                        <p>During the past two decades, the paradigm for cancer treatment has evolved from relatively
                            non-specific cytotoxic agents to selective, mechanism-based therapeutics.</p>
                        <p>Cancer chemotherapies were initially identified through screens for compounds that killed
                            rapidly
                            dividing cells. Take actinomycin as an example, antibiotics of actinomycin series are
                            classic
                            drugs
                            for tumor chemotherapy. This application is based on the ability of actinomycins to form
                            specific
                            stable complexes with DNA, leading to inhibition of RNA polymerase reaction and resulting in
                            suppression of protein synthesis and cell division [4]. These drugs remain a backbone of
                            current
                            treatment, but are limited by a narrow therapeutic index, significant toxicities, and
                            frequently
                            acquired resistance.
                        </p>
                        <p> More recently, an improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis has given rise to new
                            treatment
                            options, including targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy. Targeted approaches aim to
                            inhibit
                            molecular pathways that are critical to tumor growth and maintenance, whereas immunotherapy
                            endeavors to stimulate a host response that effectuates long-lived tumor destruction [5].

                        <h3>【Oncolytic Virus】</h3>
                        <p>Oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach to cancer treatment that
                            utilizes
                            native or genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate within tumor cells. OVs
                            mediate antitumor activity through two distinct mechanisms of action: selective replication
                            within neoplastic cells, resulting in a direct lytic effect on tumor cells and induction of
                            systemic antitumor immunity [7].</p>
                        <p>The tumor selectivity of OVs is largely conferred by tumor-specific aberrations in signaling
                            pathways that normally sense and block viral replication [8]. It is now well established
                            that
                            cancer-specific aberrations in RAS, TP53, RB1, PTEN, genes encoding proteins involved in the
                            WNT
                            signaling pathway and other cancer-related genes can predispose cancer cells to virus
                            infection
                            [9]. This is due to crosstalk between oncogenic signaling and antiviral pathways, which
                            creates
                            a permissive environment for viral replication.</p>
                        <p>The immune response to oncolytic viruses appears to be a more important component of the
                            antitumor effect. In nature, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to overcome immune
                            attack,
                            enabling OVs to promote an immune response against the tumor cells by allowing tumor antigen
                            presentation in the context of an active viral infection.</p>
                        <p>As we gain a more complete understanding of the molecular interplay between viruses and our
                            immune systems, it becomes increasingly possible to design therapeutic strategies that turn
                            viruses from stealth pathogens to finely tuned ‘viroceuticals’ that initiate both
                            viral-mediated
                            and immune-mediated attacks against cancers [10].</p>
                        <p>The effectiveness of OVs has been demonstrated in many preclinical studies and recently in
                            humans, with US Food and Drug Administration approval of the oncolytic herpesvirus
                            Talimogene
                            laherparepvec (T-Vec) in advanced melanoma, a breakthrough for the field [11]. Moreover,
                            some of
                            the cancer-targeted multimechanistic oncolytic viruses have been proven to be well-tolerated
                            in
                            clinical trials, with patients exhibiting only mild flu-like symptoms, offering great
                            potential
                            for increasing efficacy while eliminating the side effects [12]. Thus, the OV approach to
                            cancer
                            therapy is becoming more interesting for scientists, clinicians, and the public.

                            autonomous county, Hainan island in 1964. Phylogenetic analysis showed that M-1 grouped with
                            GETV first and then grouped together with SAGV. The genome of M1 is single-plus RNA, with a
                            total length of 11,696 nt, encoding 4 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3 and RdRP) and 5
                            structural proteins (E1, E2, E3, C and 6K) [13].</P>
                        <P> Compared with the oncolytic virus (including modified poxvirus, herpes virus, measles virus,
                            Newcastle disease virus, etc.) currently in clinical trials and the approved H101 and T-Vec
                            viruses, the most significant advantage of M1 is that it is highly safe and can be injected
                            intravenously. Getah virus, which is highly similar to M1 virus, mainly infects horses and
                            pigs,
                            causing mild symptoms such as fever, rash, edema of hind limbs and enlarged lymph nodes, and
                            generally recovered within 1 week, presenting a benign course [14]. Although Getah virus is
                            widely distributed in southeast Asia, Australia, Japan, Mongolia, Russia and China, no human
                            diseases caused by Getah virus have been reported so far. Domestic and foreign
                            epidemiological
                            studies have shown that Getah virus antibody can be detected in normal people, which
                            explains
                            the advantages of a virus with lower risk of disease from another perspective [15].</P>
                        <P>At the same time, studies have shown that oncolytic virus M1 has a broad anti-cancer

                            but
                            has no killing effect on normal cells. Studies have shown [16-18] that key molecular
                            mechanisms
                            of oncolytic virus M1 targeting tumor cells include zinc finger antiviral protein ZAP, RHO
                            family protein TC10, and UPR signaling molecule IRE1α. These three proteins play an
                            antiviral
                            role in the intracellular life history of M1: ZAP binds and degrades viral RNA; TC10
                            inhibits
                            virus transport; IRE1α removes viral proteins by activating autophagy. Their low expression
                            in
                            tumors allows M1 virus to selectively replicate in large numbers of tumor cells and play a
                            role
                            in its oncolytic effect.</P>
                        <P>Overall animal experiments showed that M1 injected by caudal vein and intratumoral injection
                            could significantly accumulate in tumor tissues and inhibit tumor growth, while normal
                            organs
                            were not affected. In addition to cell and animal experiments, the oncolytic effect of
                            oncolytic
                            virus M1 ex vivo was further confirmed [16]</P>
                        <P>Despite all those advantages of M1, however, results from normal and tumor cell models,
                            immunodeficient and immunohealthy tumor-bearing mice models, and ex vivo clinical tumor
                            culture
                            models have revealed its drawbacks. The sensitivity rate of the cell model was 48% (32/67
                            tumor
                            cells) and that of the ex vivo model was 36% (17/47 tumor samples) [3]. Obviously, the
                            existing
                            oncolytic virus M1 still has the necessary and development space to enhance the anti-tumor
                            spectrum and anti-cancer activity.</P>

                        <h3>【Improvement】</h3>
                        <p>It is generally believed that the limited application of M1 virus is mainly attributed to
                            pathways involved by ZAP, RHQQ, IRE1α and MXRA8 in insensitive tumor cells, lead to the
                            impairment of invasion and replication of the virus [18]. Research shows that using
                            inhibitors
                            to reduce those protein levels can to some extent improve the curative effect of oncolytic
                            viruses in several tumors, which may be a clue to further research.</p>
                        <p>However, since the underlying genesis and development mechanism of tumor itself is still far
                            from being thoroughly studied, it is unrealistic to increase M1 infection rate by studying
                            the
                            pathway of tumor cells one by one. It is more reasonable to find a solution so that the
                            anti-cancer spectrum of M1 can no longer be restricted by the limitations of the pathways in
                            tumor cells. In other words, could we find a pathway more upstream than ZAP, TC10 and IRE1α,
                            that is common to all tumor cells, to be utilized by M1?</p>
                        <p>One of the most remarkable features of tumors is their limitless replicative potential which
                            was
                            acquired during tumor progression and was essential for the development of their malignant
                            growth state [19]. The ability of unlimited proliferation is reflected in the hyperactive
                            transcription process at the cellular level. Therefore, we want to find a means to interfere
                            with tumor cells at the transcriptional level and then enhance the infection rate and
                            lethality
                            of M1.</p>
                        <p>Surprisingly, many chemotherapy drugs work through this mechanism. Actinomycin D, as a
                            typical
                            representative among actinomycins, has been widely used in clinical practice since 1954 as
                            an
                            anticancer drug for treating many tumors. The two main mechanisms of its anti-tumor ability
                            are
                            intercalation to DNA and the stabilization of cleavable complexes of topoisomerases I and II
                            with DNA, which interferes with cell transcription, but does not affect alphavirus
                            replication
                            or cytopathic vacuoles formation [20].
                        </p>
                        <p> As early as 1963, a study suggested that actinomycin D could enhance the growth of
                            Chikungunya
                            virus, which is also an alphavirus, within tumor cells through some cellular mechanism [21].
                            Also, the yield of SFV could be increased at least 50% in the cells pretreated with
                            actinomycin
                            D [20]. More studies have also confirmed that actinomycin D promotes the replication of
                            alphavirus in tumor cells significantly, for it can help to suppress cellular functions
                            which
                            inhibit production of infectious virus particles. Those possible mechanism may include
                            interferon and cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) [21-23].</p>
                        <p> These chemotherapies, which act on the transcription process, could effectively increase the
                            infection rate of M1 against a variety of tumor cells, however, the broad-spectrum effect
                            also
                            causes serious side effects. All this suggests that there might be a feasible way to expand
                            the
                            anti-cancer profile of M1 while reducing the side effects of chemotherapy drugs by combining
                            the
                            therapies together, fostering their strengths and circumventing the weaknesses.</p>

                    In our project, we proved that the efficacy of M1-directed nitroreductase system in combination with
                    CB1954, which made it possible to use M1 vector to combine with other chemotherapy drugs. Previous
                    studies have shown that there are many side effects of chemotherapy, such as myelosuppression,
                    gastrointestinal reactions, liver function impairment etc. So it is necessary to improve the target
                    of these drugs. Therefore, we plan to screen for more effective chemotherapy drugs, such as
                    Etoposide, Daunorubicin etc., to combine with M1-directed enzyme prodrug system.

                    Virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy is one of the major strategy of the targeted delivery of
                    cytotoxic compounds to tumor tissue, increasing cytotoxicity of bioreductive agents[6]. The vitro
                    experiment of the prodrug system has demonstrated the effectiveness of the combined therapy. The
                    5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB1954) is a mature anticancer prodrug that is efficiently
                    reduced by nitroreductase, requiring reduction to the 2-and 4-hydroxylamines to be cytotoxic CB1954.
                    M1 virus has good target and safety, which can achieve the targeting of CB1954. With the merit of
                    increasing effective killing of tumor cells and being less damage to the surrounding normal tissues,
                    this combined therapy is possible to be applied to medical and clinical treatment in the future.
                    Although M1-directed nitroreductase therapy have shown effective bystander effect of CB1954 in
                    vitro, the study to prove this system in vivo has not been done. Therefore, more researches are
                    needed to improve this therapy.
