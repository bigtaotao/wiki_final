            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith the increasing incidence and mortality of cancer, there are many limitations of
                the current
                anti-tumor treatments. So the original idea of our project was to improve the cancer therapies, we were
                looking for a new treatment that combines the strengths of the current approaches. Later, we found that
                oncolytic virus therapy has recently been recognized as a promising new therapeutic approach for cancer
                treatment. It combines immune therapy, gene therapy and advantages of targeted drugs, which can
                selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells without harming the normal tissues. In contrast to gene
                therapy where a virus is used as a mere carrier for transgene delivery, oncolytic virus therapy uses the
                virus itself as an active drug reagent.

                <source src="./src/design_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough the advantages of oncolytic virus are obvious, the ability of the virus to
                spread in tumor also
                limit the efficacy of oncolytic virus. To expand the anti-tumor effect of M1, we further studied the
                mechanism of M1, and then we have hypothesized that if M1 is combined with a chemotherapy drug that acts
                on DNA double-stranded, the combined treatment could induce better antitumor effect efficiently.
                Therefore, Actinomycin D, Etoposide and other drugs were selected, and it was found that actinomycin D
                had the most significant effect. Furthermore, it even has a powerful effect on enhancing M1's infection
                to tumor cells.

        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, Actinomycin D has many side effects, such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal
            reactions, liver
            function impairment etc. Accordingly, it is of vital importance to improve its targeting ability, which is
            exactly one of the most significant advantages of M1.

        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPrevious studies have reported that the prodrug of actinomycin D can be activated by
            nitroreductase.
            Therefore, we designed this system to combine M1 virus with actinomycin D for cancer treatment. We
            engineered M1 armed with nitroreductase, and after nitroreductase was delivered to the cancer cell by M1 and
            expressed, the enzyme can activate subsequently administered prodrugs of actinomycin D to potent drugs.
            Further, actinomycin D can promote the replication of M1 virus, which made up a constant reinforcing system.

            In addition, in order to ensure the controllability and safety of the system, we used engineered
            riboswitches to control gene expression of M1 armed with nitroreductase.

        <h4 class="content-5-h4">However, after we did the pre-experiments of two projects, the results was not as
            expect. So we decided to try another project to expand the anti-cancer spectrum of M1 virus. We designed to
            engineer M1 to specifically encode and express enzymes that can convert prodrugs into active therapeutic
            metabolites and enhance bystander effects of chemicals. Finally, we proved that this project was feasible.

                Directed evolution
            </h3>
            <p>Since the interaction between virus and host is extremely complex and diverse, and a large number of
                molecular interaction regulatory networks have not been clarified, the ability to use these molecular
                mechanisms for virus modification is limited.
                The biggest difference between oncolytic virus and replicator-deficient virus vectors and other
                anticancer drugs is that OVs can replicate and mutate, and thus has the potential to evolve under the
                pressure of natural selection, and the direction of evolution can be directed in a controlled laboratory
                environment.
                Therefore, we considered to construct the M1 with low fidelity RNA polymerase to increase the
                probability of mutation caused by adaptation. In addition, we inserted ligands of receptors that are
                highly expressed in some tumors, which aims to enhance the affinity between M1 and insensitive tumor
                cells.

                    Three-dimensional cell culture model can better simulate the natural developing environment in vivo.
                    3D
                    cell culture can establish physiological cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interaction and
                    restore
                    the metabolic pattern of cells in tissues, so as to be closer to the characteristics of natural
                    tissues.
                    Its physiological correlation is significantly stronger than traditional two-dimensional cell
                    culture.
                    This is important in cancer research.
                    Recent studies have reported that a variety of oncolytic viruses have developed a new generation of
                    oncolytic viruses using three-dimensional culture models, such as adenovirus for the treatment of
                    colon
                    cancer, reovirus for the treatment of glioblastoma, herpes simplex virus for the treatment of
                    melanoma
                    and breast cancer, etc. </p>

                    We considered to use 3D culture to improve the fitness of M1 to insensitive cells, in order to
                    expand
                    the anti-tumor spectrum of M1 and enhance its anti- tumor effect. </p>

                    1. It could not only reduce the fitness of normal cells and improve the safety of M1, but also
                    enhance
                    the oncolysis of M1 and develop the next generation of effective oncolytic virus M1.</p>
                <p>
                    2. The data that we obtained from 3D culture are more clinically relevant. </p>

                <p>
                    One major problem in the field is the lack of a standard approach in 3D cultures, whereas 2D cell
                    culture practice is standard and roughly comparable. </p>
