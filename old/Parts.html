					<h3>Luciferase </h3>
					<p>Luciferase reporter system is a luciferin as a substrate to detect fireflyluciferase activity.Luciferin oxidation can then be measured using a fluorescence meter, also known as a luminometer, or liquid flashover meter.Luciferin and luciferase, a bioluminescence system, can detect gene expression extremely sensitively and efficiently.It is a method to detect the interaction between transcription factors and the promoter region of the target gene.</p>
					<h3>Sequence and features</h3>
					<p>The luciferase was linked into the expression vector by restriction sites EcoRI and PstI , and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification(Fig.1), sequencing of the recombinant plasmid (Fig.2)and In vivo imaging of mice(Fig.3).</p>

					<h2>1002</h2>
					<h3>EGF</h3>
					<p>A series of ligands were integrated into the genome of M1 virus, EGF is one of them, which is short for Epidermal Growth Factor, Such a part overexpressed in our engineered M1 virus could enhance the affinity between M1 virus and cancer cells so that it could improve the possibility of favorable mutations. </p>

					<h2>1004</h2>
					<h3>CMV promoter+eGFP</h3>
					<p>CMV promoter is recognized as the most powerful promoter to start the gene expression of eukaryon. Here we also insert eGFP which is a type of GFP derivatives by mutation to assess the effect of the gene expression in eukaryon. eGFP mutation greatly improved the spectral characteristics of GFP, resulting in increased fluorescence, photostability, and a shift of the major excitation peak to 488 nm, with the peak emission kept at 509 nm[1]. This matched the spectral characteristics of commonly available FITC filter sets, so it could be used by the researcher more efficiently, such as using it in mammalian cells.</p>
					<h3>Sequence and features</h3>
					<p>The CMV+eGFP was linked into the expression vector between the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI using the Multiple fragment homologous recombination, and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification(Fig.1), sequencing of the recombinant plasmid (Fig.2)and the image of transfection cells observed under a fluorescence microscope (Fig.3).</p>

					<h2>1005</h2>
					<h3>CMV promoter+ Riboswitches+eGFP</h3>
					<p>Riboswitches is an element comprising a ribozyme actuator and RNA aptamer sensor, which could bind to a series of small molecular metabolites and iron ions to regulates transcription, translation, splicing and the stability of RNA [2].</p>
					<p>In our project, we use a kind of riboswitch developed from the hammerhead ribozyme from the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTRSV) conjugated to a theophylline aptamer. It’s an OFF-type riboswitch, which inhibits ribozyme cleavage in the absence of theophylline, but addition of theophylline allows the ribozyme to form its active conformation and initiate cleavage, turning gene expression off. By adding theophylline or not, we can control the expression of the pro-drug gene attached to M1 virus, which greatly improves the safety of M1 virus and efficiency of gene expression.</p>
					<p>The CMV+riboswitches+eGFP was linked into the expression vector between the restriction sites EcoRI and PstI using the Multiple fragment homologous recombination, and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification(Fig.1), sequencing of the recombinant plasmid (Fig.2)and the image of transfection cells with or without theophylline observed under a fluorescence microscope which can reflect whether the riboswitch is effective (Fig.3).</p>

					<h2>1006</h2>
					<h3>CMV promoter+ Riboswitches+ CPG2+eGFP</h3>
					<p>Carboxypeptidase is a kind of peptidase that specifically degrades and releases free amino acids from the C end of the peptide chain. And the ligand we use in our project is G2 type which could cleave C-terminal Glu under N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate structure. In our project we also carried out human codon optimization on the original CPG2 and added flag tag for labeling to increase protein expression and make detection easier.</p>
					<h3>Sequence and features</h3>
					<p>The CMV promoter+ Riboswitches+Nitroreductase+eGFP was linked into the expression vector by restriction sites EcoRI and PstI , and the correct construction of this recombinant plasmid was confirmed by PCR identification(Fig.1), sequencing of the recombinant plasmid (Fig.2)and western blot(Fig.3). The activity of the nitroreductase which can turn the prodrug to the chemicals killing cells are assessed by measuring the survival rate of the cells (Fig.4).</p>

					<h2>1007</h2>
					<h3>CMV promoter+ Riboswitches+Nitroreductase+eGFP</h3>
					<p>Nitroreductase is an enzyme that can catalyze the reduction of nitro aromatic compounds to aromatic amines. In our project we optimized the nitroreductase that we carried out human codon optimization on the original nitro reductase and added flag tag for labeling, which Increases the expression of protein as well as detection .</p>
